## React

Our React framework provides tools to leverage the PubNub JavaScript SDK within a React application by making use of React features like Provider and Consumer patterns and React Hooks.

## Redux

Our Redux framework makes it easier for you to manage the state of data components inside an application. 
The framework adds structured data to the Redux store, listens to realtime events generated by the network, stores these events on the client side, and triggers updates to the view inside your application.
These Redux-specific functions can be integrated with your existing or new Redux data store.

## Javascript

Our React and Redux frameworks have a dependency on the Javascript SDK to manage connections and communicate with the PubNub network.
